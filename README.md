# Star Wars Clicky Game

## Overview

This is a fun little clicking memory game, testing your capability for memorizing details and keeping track of what you've done before.

It has increasing levels of difficulty, including a whole second hardmode starting at level 5 - which you can skip ahead to if you want to try your hand at it!

## Instructions
Navigate yourself to the website found here: [ "Star Wars clicky game!"](https://bsessio.github.io/starwarsclickygame)

Click on any image, which will then shuffle the entire picture set, and choose again. And again. Repeat until you either win the level, or you lose!

If you click the same picture twice, you've lost the game. But if you get through them all, you will reach the next level! There are 8 levels total for you to pass through. 

Good luck! You'll need it.
